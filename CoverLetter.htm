Dear Mr. John,
<br>
<br>
I want to work in law so that I can make use of my skills with Ms Word and Spreadsheets along with my fast typing and newly acquired coding skills. Lawyers have to create contracts and other legally binding documents for their clients all the time and with my knowledge and experience I could create these documents much faster than anyone without the skills set I obtained from BTT101. Law and litigation has always intrigued me and with my skills and dedication I think I would be a perfect fit for your company. I have all the credentials and qualifications to be accepted into the company and if I am accepted I will practice the patience and kindness that any good lawyer would need to give their customers the most satisfaction for their money. Thank you for sitting down and taking the time to read my letter, I hope I'm in consideration and I will be eagerly awaiting your response.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
<br>
Liam Daya
