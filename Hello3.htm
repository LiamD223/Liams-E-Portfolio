<h1>Key Summary<h1>
<h3>I am a grade student at St. Edmund Campion. The grade nine business course I took has helped me learn how to type efficiently at an average speed of 50 words per minute and additionally I am able to create my own website or html file which my future employers will find a useful skill to have when drafting something confidential that must stay within the company. I know a few things already about law and business and I have used my skills already for things such as writing, graphic design, websites, emails, letters, and word documents. I have experience with tools such as Microsoft Word and Spreadsheets that will make me a valuable asset to your company.</h3>

<h1>Volunteer Work<h1>
<h2>My Mosque<h2>
<h3>I help people at my Mosque with food donations, finding their seats, opening the door for them to come inside and even take part in organising some celebratory events.

<h2>My School<h2>
<h3>Over the summer my school allowed the grade 8s of that year to come for the summer and volunteer as an early start to the hours work we'd have to do to complete high school. My class helped with the summer camp program and were assigned to varying activity stations each day, all of them designed to teach the little kids something educational of course.

<h2>My Community<h2>
<h3>This year and the last, during the winter season, I would help out my neighbors with snow shoveling and while we didn't get much snow this year, when it did snow a lot, my neighbors could count on me to help.</h3>
